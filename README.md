**ARES V4.0** is an open-source conceptual architecture and numerical simulation suite for a high-efficiency, reusable deep-space cargo freighter. Originally engineered with nuclear propulsion, the design has been fully upgraded to Version 4.0 to meet commercial viability, fast-track regulatory clearance, and sustainability targets for the **2030** flight window.

The spacecraft operates across a standardized two-stage mission roadmap: **Phase I (Lunar Mission)**, validating cislunar logistics on an autonomous round-trip profile, and **Phase II (Mars Mission - Project Prometheus I)**, executing high-energy interplanetary transport. The vehicle launches and refuels at the **Alcantara Space Center (CLA), Brazil**.

## 🚀 Version 4.0 Technical Innovations

To maximize cost-effectiveness and eliminate the core engineering bottlenecks of previous iterations, the V4.0 architecture implements four foundational pillars:

1. **Solar Thermal Propulsion (STP):** Complete replacement of heavy nuclear reactors with high-precision inflatable parabolic concentrators. The system captures raw solar flux to superheat the propellant, generating a real vacuum specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) of **620 seconds** without radiological safety liabilities or massive radiation shielding weight penalties.
2. **Liquid Methane ($LCH_4$) Migration:** Propellant optimized from molecular hydrogen to high-density liquid methane (422.6 kg/m³). This drastically reduced tank volume inside the 9-meter diameter hull—stabilizing total vehicle height at **49.3 meters**—while securing cheap fuel procurement and enabling future Mars atmospheric ISRU (Sabatier Reaction).
3. **Zero-Corrosion Core (Target 2030):** The thermal absorption and expansion chamber utilizes a refractory **Tantalum-Hafnium Carbide ($Ta_4HfC_5$)** ceramic matrix lined with an atomic thin-film of **Iridium**. This completely eliminates fuel-induced oxidation and chemical erosion under 3200 K operating conditions.
4. **Active Zero Boil-Off (ZBO) Technology:** To halt cryo-fuel evaporation over deep-space transits, the hull integrates 60-layer Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) coupled with active **Pulse Tube Cryocoolers**. The closed-loop helium system draws a steady 2.5 kWe to maintain methane liquified indefinitely.
